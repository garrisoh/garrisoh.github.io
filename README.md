# Haley Garrison

This branch contains the distribution files for my personal website.  To view the project with the development files, check out the dev branch.

## Navigating my Github Account

My website contains several links to repositories on my Github account.  Several of the projects are collaborative efforts and contain code from multiple contributors.  This documentation will help guide you through each project and identify where to look for my code.

### BCI Drone Control

If you are looking for code and documentation representative of my style, this is the best repo to look at.  All of the code and documentation (except the Emotiv library code) was written exclusively by me and is very typical of my style.  This project is also a very complete, self-contained application and has been used by many Lafayette College researchers since its creation.

### garrisoh.github.io

For an example of my style of (static) web development, take a look at the code in this repo.  To see how I used various development tools, view the dev branch of this repo.  All code in this repo was written by me.  The code/directory structure was designed to be very simplistic, so it should be easy to follow.  For an example of a more complex, dynamic web app, take a look at the generator-meanerjs project, but be aware that it is still under heavy development.

### generator-meanerjs

This project demonstrates a combination of Node.js code and full stack web app development with MEAN.  All code and documentation was written exclusively by me, but note that only some of the functionality is completed and documented.  A working version of the barebones application generator can be found on the repo along with its documentation.  To view the simple barebones application template, view the `app/templates/barebones` directory.  Although the default generator has not yet been developed, to preview the code for the user authentication app, view the `app/templates/default` directory.  The default template documentation is not currently complete, but the directory structure is very similar to the barebones app as described in the project's README.  For examples of Node.js code, you can look at any of the index.js files for each of the generators.

### Simon-ConCATination

The Simon game was a collaborative effort including myself and three other students.  All files in the `InterfaceManagers/` directory (except the Leap.h and LeapMath.h library files) and the `StateMachines/` directory were written by me.  The README file was written by me, but the Doxygen docs combine documentation from all four students.

### ASME-Drone

Although the code in this repository was written collaboratively by a group of students, the README was written by me and demonstrates my typical documentation style.
