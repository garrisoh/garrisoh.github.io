				The Motion Control project began in the beginning of my sophomore year when a friend and
				I decided we wanted to explore 3D motion sensing technology.  We found a project idea online
				and received funding from the Lafayette College ECE department.  The project was to build our
				own 3D motion sensor.  It consisted of three square pieces of cardboard with aluminum foil
				glued to one side of each piece.  The three pieces were taped together at one corner to form
				half of a cube.  Then using an Arduino microcontroller board, we applied a charge to each of
				the three plates and measured the voltage at each one.  These plates could then act as
				variable capacitances as we moved our hand around inside the cube.  By measuring the voltage
				at each plate, we can then calculate the position of our hand.  We used this sensor to
				control the mouse on a computer screen where moving our hand forward signaled a mouse click.
			</p>
			<p>
				After completing this project, we decided to continue exploring motion control but to increase
				the scale and difficulty of the project.  We merged with our school's American Society of
				Mechanical Engineers (ASME) club as one of the long-term projects or "tech teams."  These teams
				function as smaller clubs within ASME to work on projects related to a specific area of study.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our new project concept was to control a robotic arm with a 
				<a href="http://www.leapmotion.com/">LeapMotion</a> controller.  The robot arm that we used
				belonged to the ECE department for use with our Digital Circuits II course.  We assembled a
				team of students with me as the team leader and began working on this new project.  After 
				just over a semester of working on this project, we completed our goal.  The video above
				shows the project in action, displaying basic movement, grip action controlled by the
				openness of our hand, and my (highly uncoordinated) attempt at stacking blocks.
			</p>
			<p>
				After we completed the robot arm project, we implemented a similar system with the
				<a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com">Parrot Ar.drone</a>.  We were able to map the rotation
				of the user's hand to the pitch, roll, and vertical velocity of the drone using the LeapMotion.
				We were also able to produce a live video stream from the drone's front-facing camera to the
				controlling computer.  Our goal for future projects with this system would be to implement
				a first person view control using a virtual reality headset.
			</p>
			<p>
				The source code for the robot project can be found on 
				<a href="http://www.github.com/garrisoh/Robot-Project">Github</a>.  The project was written
				in Java.  For examples of my code, you can look at SerialManager.java, SerialComm.java, View.java,
				and RobotArduino.ino (other classes were written by other team members).
