			<p>
				PassVault is the first iOS application that I developed from start to finish.  After
				first learning how to write iOS applications, my father came up with the idea for an
				app that keeps track of passwords, allowing you to have only one single master
				password to remember rather than trying to keep track of dozens of different accounts
				and passwords.  I decided that I would build it for him, customizing it be exactly what
				he was looking for.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app begins with a screen that prompts the user for the master password, or if a
				master password has not yet been created, it prompts the user to enter one.  If the
				password is correct, the app opens the vault and displays a table view of accounts.
				If the password is incorrect, an alert will display the number of tries remaining
				until the user becomes locked out.  This screen appears any time the user returns
				from the home screen or lock screen.  In the main vault, users can search
				or edit entries.  They can select the "add" tab to add a new entry.  Usernames and 
				passwords can also be copied to the clipboard to use in other applications.  The
				settings screen allows the user to change the master password or change the type of
				password (alphanumeric or just numeric) or to change the number of tries until lockout
				and time until unlocked.
			</p>
			<p>
				All passwords are stored in the app's keychain.  They are encrypted using Apple's iOS
				security framework through the SSKeychain library.
