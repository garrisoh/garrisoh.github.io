			<p>
				This semester, as part of my software engineering course, we are tasked with designing
				a game for one of the psychology professors at Lafayette College.  This game is based
				on the classic Simon game where users must follow the ever increasing sequence of lights
				until they make a mistake.  The professor plans to use this game to study the effects
				of different variables on a person's working memory.  The game should allow the professor
				to turn on and off sound, color, and different input devices.  We are required to use three
				different types of input devices: the keyboard, the mouse, and a 
				<a href="http://www.leapmotion.com/">LeapMotion</a> controller.  We must also write all
				user trial data out to a CSV file, including participant demographics, timing, trial
				parameters, and the longest sequence of lights pressed.
			</p>
			<p>
				For this project, we are writing the game in C++ using Qt.
				We are currently in the process of design and the beginning stages of coding.  As the
				project progresses, I will periodically update this page with more information.
