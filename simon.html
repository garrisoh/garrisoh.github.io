					The classic Simon game

			<p>
				Last semester, as part of my software engineering course, we were tasked with designing
				a game for one of the psychology professors at Lafayette College.  This game is based
				on the classic Simon game where users must follow the ever increasing sequence of lights
				until they make a mistake.  The professor plans to use this game to study the effects
				of different variables on a person's working memory.  The game allows the professor
				to turn on and off sound, color, and different input devices.  We were required to use three
				different types of input devices: the keyboard, the mouse, and a 
				<a href="http://www.leapmotion.com/">LeapMotion</a> controller.  All user trial data
				is written out to a CSV file, including participant demographics, timing, trial
				parameters, and the longest sequence of lights pressed.
			</p>

				For this project, we wrote the game in C++ using Qt.  The Mac version of the completed game 
				can be downloaded below:<br><br>
