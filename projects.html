			<h3>Motion Control</h3>
			<p>
				The Motion Control Team is one of two tech teams belonging to our school's
				American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) clubs.  It operates as a smaller club within
				ASME and is dedicated to the long-term project of exploring motion control using 3-dimensional
				motion sensors and robotics.<br><br>

			<h3>Simon</h3>
			<p>
				Simon is a large software project that I will be completing this semester as part of my
				Software Engineering course.  We are divided into teams of four with each group responsible
				for designing and programming this application for a real-life client.<br><br>

			<h3>PassVault</h3>
			<p>
				PassVault is an iOS application that I developed in my free time.  After learning how to 
				program iOS applications, my father came up with an idea for an app, so naturally, I
				decided to build it.  I recently updated the app to support iOS 7.<br><br>
