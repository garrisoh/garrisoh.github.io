				My name is Haley Garrison, and this is my personal website.  The purpose of this page is to
				provide information to potential employers or anyone else who may stumble across it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I am a third year student at Lafayette College.  I am studying Electrical and
				Computer Engineering and International Studies.  I also have a passion for Computer
				Science and spend a great deal of time programming outside of the classroom (hence the
				webpage).  Though I have taken some courses in CS, I am largely self taught as I enjoy the
				challenge of independent learning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides programming, I enjoy travel, especially to places where it is warm.  I have been
				all over the Caribbean, as my family often takes cruises to the Caribbean over summer or
				winter break.  Nothing like Christmas on the beach!  I also spent a semester abroad
				in Spain, and I speak near fluent Spanish.  While I was abroad, I also visited France, 
				Germany, Belgium, and Morocco.  It was one of the best experiences of my life, and I learned
				a lot about foreign cultures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feel free to explore my website.  You will find personal information, descriptions of my
				experience, my resume, and a list of projects that I have completed.  My contact information
				can also be found under the "contact" link listed above.
