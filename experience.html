			<h3>Prior Work Experience</h3>
			<p>
				<i>Metso Minerals</i><br><br>
				During the summer of 2012, I worked full-time as an intern at 
				<a href="http://www.metso.com/">Metso Minerals</a>
				in York, PA.  There I assisted one of the electrical engineers in the creation and revision
				of several different types of electrical diagrams, including:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Process & Instrumentation Diagram</li>
					<li>Instrumentation I/O List</li>
					<li>Recommended Logic Schematic</li>
					<li>Functional Description (Control Philosophy)</li>
					<li>Motor Load List</li>
				</ul>
				I created these diagrams for two different types of mineral grinding mills: the
				<a href="http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/mm_grin.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041122-2256F-74BB9#.UydSMNxIi5c">
				VERTIMILL&reg;</a> and the 
				<a href="http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/mm_grin.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041123-2256F-B244E#.UydSotxIi5c">
				Stirred Media Detritor (SMD)</a>
				The electrical diagrams for these machines focused on the instrumentation and control systems
				necessary to operate the mills.  I created and revised these diagrams using programs such as
				AutoCAD and Microsoft Excel and learned how to use the SAP database system to store documents
				and track revisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				While at Metso, I was also able to experience a professional environment.  I learned how to
				conduct myself in such a situation, and I was also exposed to the engineering process.  I
				was able to sit in on several meetings and observe discussions on projects at various stages
				of their design.  I also had the opportunity to see parts of the machines I was working on
				in the field, allowing me to see beyond the design stages and into the construction stage.
				Overall, I believe that it was a fantastic first experience for a first technical internship.
