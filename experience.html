			<h3>Prior Work Experience</h3>
			<p>
				<i>Metso Minerals</i><br><br>
				During the summer of 2013, I worked full-time as an intern at 
				<a href="http://www.metso.com/">Metso Minerals</a>
				in York, PA.  There I assisted one of the electrical engineers in the creation and revision
				of several different types of electrical diagrams, including:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Process & Instrumentation Diagram</li>
					<li>Instrumentation I/O List</li>
					<li>Recommended Logic Schematic</li>
					<li>Functional Description (Control Philosophy)</li>
					<li>Motor Load List</li>
				</ul>
				I created these diagrams for two different types of mineral grinding mills: the
				<a href="http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/mm_grin.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041122-2256F-74BB9#.UydSMNxIi5c">
				VERTIMILL&reg;</a> and the 
				<a href="http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/mm_grin.nsf/WebWID/WTB-041123-2256F-B244E#.UydSotxIi5c">
				Stirred Media Detritor (SMD)</a>
				The electrical diagrams for these machines focused on the instrumentation and control systems
				necessary to operate the mills.  I created and revised these diagrams using programs such as
				AutoCAD and Microsoft Excel and learned how to use the SAP database system to store documents
				and track revisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				While at Metso, I was also able to experience a professional environment.  I learned how to
				conduct myself in such a situation, and I was also exposed to the engineering process.  I
				was able to sit in on several meetings and observe discussions on projects at various stages
				of development.  I also had the opportunity to see parts of the machines I was working on
				in the field, allowing me to see beyond the design stages and into the construction stage.
				Overall, I believe that it was a fantastic first experience for a first technical internship.

				<i>Voith Hydro York</i><br><br>
				In the summer of 2014, I worked as an intern with Automation Engineering at
				<a href="http://www.york.voithhydro.com/e_york.htm">Voith Hydro, York</a>.  While at Voith,
				I worked on two different projects.  The first involved implenting a macro-enabled
				spreadsheet to serve as a selection criteria for Automation cabinet parts.  The macros 
				could be used to import the Bill of Materials from each cabinet and each project and
				parts would be automatically sorted based on the project where the part was used and
				the frequency with which the respective part was used.  The motivation for developing this
				software was to streamline the development of Bill of Materials for new projects and to
				provide an organizational system for the existing parts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second project that I worked on as an intern at Voith Hydro was the development of a
				simulation program for testing PLC logic and providing operator training using MiMiC
				Simulation Software.  I was able to develop a test program that simulated real physical
				I/O from the plant, including the start/stop sequence and conditions such as temperature
				and pressure.

			<h3>International Experience</h3>

			<p>
				As part of an immersion requirement for my International Studies degree, I went on a study
				abroad trip to Madrid, Spain in the spring semester of 2013.  This trip is hosted each
				year by the engineering program at Lafayette.  A group of 25 students and a Lafayette
				professor go abroad for a semester and study at Saint Louis University (SLU), Madrid.
				I lived with a Spanish host family in the city and had a 20 minute walk to school each
				day.  This was a fantastic experience as I got to experience the Spanish culture first-hand
				and practice speaking Spanish with my host parents every evening at the dinner table.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I was abroad, I spent breaks traveling around Spain and Europe.  We took class trips
				to Segovia, Toledo, El Escorial, and San Sebasti&aacuten in Spain as well as to Toulouse, France
				and Morocco.  I also visited Trujillo, C&aacuteceres, and M&eacuterida in Spain, Brussels, Belgium, and
				visited a friend studying abroad in Dresden, Germany.  The video above is a slideshow of
				some of the pictures I took while I visited each of these places.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>Volunteerism</i><br><br>
				While I was abroad, I also took advantage of a volunteer opportunity that I found at SLU, Madrid.
				I began volunteering at one of the "colegio's" (similar to elementary school) by helping the
				students with their English homework in an after-school study session.  I would spend about an
				hour every Monday and Wednesday with the kids (ages from around 9-12) helping with homework
				assignments, preparing for exams, and reviewing vocabulary.  We often played pictionary or
				hangman in English to practice vocabulary and spelling.  It was a challenging, but very rewarding
				experience for me to be able to help the kids and provide them with the opportunity to hear a
				native speaker.
