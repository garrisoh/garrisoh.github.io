			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				I was essentially born and raised in Pennsylvania.  I lived briefly in Baton Rouge, Louisianna for
				a few years when I was very little.  My younger sister, Beth, was born there, and when I was four,
				my family moved to Southern York County, PA.  The snowy image shown above is a view looking out
				the window of the house where I grew up.  To me, it is one of the most beautiful places in the
				world, and I enjoy spending my summers and school breaks there when I can.  Both of my parents
				work nearby as Mechanical Engineering professors at York College of Pennsylvania, and my sister
				is currently a freshman at Muhlenberg College.

					My cat, Nala, but everyone calls her Jeanie.

								I have always been a big animal lover.  At home, I have a cat, Nala, that I adore and two dogs,
				T-bone and Elmo.  At the age of four, I began to learn how to ride horses.
				I became an active member of the United States Pony Clubs and frequently attended competitions
				in a wide variety of horse disciplines, including hunt seat, show jumping, dressage, eventing,
				and mounted games.  I also enjoyed training my horses.  When I was about twelve years old, I
				rescued a small pony from an abusive situation.  I taught him to trust people and broke him to
				ride and drive a cart.  I continued working with horses up until college, when I found that I
				no longer had the time to give to the sport.

				Growing up, I attended Southern Elementary and Middle Schools and Susquehannock High school from
				grades K-12.  My senior year at Susquehannock, I did dual enrollment at York College, so I spent
				mornings taking several courses at York and returned to high school in the afternoon.  In spring
				of that year, I ended up taking Engineering Physics with "professor Dad."  Good thing I did well
				in that course...  In 2011, I graduated from Susquehannock as the Salutatorian of my class.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, I am a junior ECE and International Studies dual major at Lafayette College.  I have
				had a great experience at Lafayette, and it has become like a second home to me.  I live in a
				college-owned off-campus house that is part of a group of Living Learning Communities (LLC's).
				Each house is given a name related to a specific topic, and students in each house are expected
				to hold events related to the topic.  We are the technology house, so we hold events related to
				hands-on exploration of modern and ancient technology.  We have done everything from chainmaille
				to textiles to building solar chargers.  I love the sense of community that
				living in this house has brought me.  We have organized a cooking co-op, so each of us cooks
				one night of the week and we all get to chat while we eat homemade dinner every night.  It has
				been a great way to meet new people and to relax after a long day of classes.
			</p>

				In the future, I would like to go to graduate school.  I would love to be able to study robotics
				(because let's be honest, robots are awesome).  I have worked on several projects involving
				robots (see the projects link above), and I have enjoyed every minute of them.  I find myself
				especially drawn to flying robots and would love to do more projects with them.
